# QJ.MPMZ.RC({},{},{})

<font size=4>The meaning of "RC" in this projectile command is "Relative Combination", which means that using this command will launch a set of projectiles at once.
There is one main projectile in this group, and the positions of the other projectiles (secondary projectiles) relative to the main projectile are fixed.    
And the 'relative position' here is three-dimensional. By modifying the position and angle of the main projectile, the positions of other projectile will be altered.</font>

------

<font size=4>Establish a three-dimensional coordinate system (A) with the main projectile as the origin.    
The positive direction in the x direction is the direction where the main projectile movement is offset by negative 90 degrees;    
The positive direction in the y direction is the main projectile movement direction,    
The square in the z-direction is perpendicular to the outward direction of the game screen.    
However, when displaying projectile comments in the game, there are only two dimensions (x and y), so the three dimensions here are actually a "pseudo 3D" effect composed of bullet comments.</font>

------

<font size=4>The basic format of the projectile command is:   
<br />QJ.MPMZ.RC(mainProjData,childProjData,rcData);   
<br />mainProjData：The data of the main projectile, write object {}. When we do not need to display the main projectile, please set the img data of the main pr ojectileto "white". The "white" image is a blank pixel image with a width of 1 and a height of 1.   
<br />childProjData：The data of the secondary projectiles, write object {}. There may be more than one secondary projectiles, so their position and initial rotation relative to the main projectile must be more than one. Therefore, these two attributes are actually set in the RCData below and are not set here. The position and initial rotation set in this item will be overwritten and will be invalid. In addition to these two attributes, other attributes of the secondary projectile may also be overwritten by RCData and become invalid, including moveType.   
<br />rcData：Control the position and initial rotation of the secondary projectile relative to the main projectile, and write the object {}. All writable attributes in the object and their default values are:</font>

```javascript
{
    childPosition:['PY',5,72],//The number and position of secondary projectile, which refers to the display of secondary projectile at the vertices of the pentagon.
    rotation:[0,0,0],//The angle of the coordinate system of the secondary projectile relative to the coordinate system of the primary projectile.
    scale:[1,1,1],//The scaling of the coordinate system of the secondary projectile relative to the coordinate system of the primary projectile.
    translate:[0,0,0],//The offset of the coordinate system of the secondary projectile relative to the coordinate system of the main projectile.
    pitchDistance:[0,0,0],//The pitch angle distance of the secondary projectile coordinate system relative to the main projectile coordinate system.
    mainDeadToChild:{t:['BE',0],d:[0,10]},//The main projectile disappears and the secondary projectile also disappears, and when the secondary projectile disappears, it fades out within 10 frames.
    childDeadToMain:{t:['BE',0],d:[0,10]}//After all secondary projectiles disappear, the main projectile also disappears, and when the main projectile disappears, it fades out within 10 frames.
}
```

<font size=4>The specific meaning and writable values of each attribute are:   
Note that the value of * can be written as a dynamic value.</font>

Write x coordinates such as p1, p2, p3, etc. in pixels.<br /><br />D2:Directly specify the position of a point on the plane formed by the x and y axes (z coordinate defaults to 0), write p1, p2, p3, etc. as [x coordinate, y coordinate], and the units of x and y coordinates are pixels.<br /><br />D3:Directly specify the position of the midpoint in three-dimensional space. P1, P2, P3, etc. are written as [x coordinate, y coordinate, z coordinate], and the units of x, y, and z coordinates are pixels.<br /><br />CB:(cube)Generate a cube centered around the origin, with its edges parallel to the coordinate system, and generate num vertices on each edge of the cube.<br />The length of an edge is sideLength;<br />The number of points on an edge is num, which is at least 2.

|    rotation     | The offset angle of the three-dimensional coordinate system (A) in three directions.<br />Default is [0,0,0] |            [rotationX\*,rotationY\*,rotationZ\*]             | rotationX，rotationY和rotationZ：The offset angle in each direction, measured in degrees. |                          [10,20,30]                          |

|  pitchDistance  | The pitch distance of the three-dimensional coordinate system (A) in three directions.<br/><br/>The default is [0,0,0], where 0 indicates that the pitch angle setting is not enabled in this direction.<br/><br/>If you want the projectile to be close and far on a certain axis, you need to set the pitch angle so that the distance between the distant projectile and the axis decreases, and the distance between the nearby projectile and the axis increases.<br/><br/>For example, if a point is (10,10,100) and the pitch angle is [0,0,200], then the actual display position of this point will become [5,5,100]. The calculation method for 5 is 10 * 100/200, which achieves near large and far small. |                 [pitchX\*,pitchY\*,pitchZ\*]                 | pitchX，pitchY和pitchZ：The distance between the projection origin and the coordinate origin in each direction.<br /><br />This distance is usually written as a value between 100 and 500.<br /><br />For example, if there is a point (10,10100) and you want to make it smaller in the z-axis direction, it is best to write a number less than -100 for pitchZ, such as -200;<br />If you want it to be close to Xiaoyuanda, it's best to write a number greater than 100, such as 200. |                          [0,0,200]                           |
| mainDeadToChild | After the main projectile died, the sub projectile also died.<br /><br />Default is {t:['BE',0],d:[0,10]}。<br /><br />When writing null, it means that the function of 'main bullet screen death bullet screen also death' is not enabled. | This attribute needs to be written in the following style:<br />{t:['BE',0]}<br />You are free to add some data inside, but t can only write ['BE ', 0] and cannot write any other values. | The reason why it is written like this here is for your convenience in adding the effect when the projectile disappears, such as a and d in the example on the right.<br/><br/>If this value is not null, it will be added to the existData of each bullet screen.<br/><br/>In {t:['BE',0]}, t is ['BE',0], representing that when a certain projectile disappears, the current projectile also disappears. When this function is executed, the 0 in it will be automatically replaced by the main projectile number. |              {t:['BE',0],d:[0,10],a:['C',3,1]}               |
| childDeadToMain | After all the secondary projectiles died, the main projectile also died.<br /><br />Default is {t:['BE',0],d:[0,10]}，The meaning is that the main projectile only dies after all the secondary projectile dies.<br /><br />When writing null, it means that the function of 'the main projectile also dies after all the secondary projectile dies' is not enabled. | This attribute needs to be written in the following style:<br />{t:['BE',0]}<br />You are free to add some data inside, but t can only write ['BE',0] and cannot write any other values. | The reason why it is written like this here is for your convenience in adding the effect when the projectile disappears, such as a and d in the example on the right.<br/><br/>If this value is not null, then when the main projectile detects that both secondary projectiles have disappeared, make yourself disappear as well.<br/><br/>In {t: ['BE',0]}, t is ['BE',0], representing that when a certain projectile disappears, the current projectile also disappears. |              {t:['BE',0],d:[0,10],a:['C',3,1]}               |

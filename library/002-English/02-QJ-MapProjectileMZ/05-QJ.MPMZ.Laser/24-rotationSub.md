# rotationSub
<font size=4>The default value is null.    
When the rotation attribute of the laser is an incorrect value, use this value instead. Null represents non replacement.    
The relationship between the attributes initialRotation and initialRotationSub in QJ.MPMZ.ShootÂ and the relationship between the attributes rotation in QJ.MPMZ.Laser and this attribute rotationSub is the same.</font>

|              ['F']              | follow  | The rotation of image is the same as the rotation of moving. |     ['F']     |
|      ['F',rotationOffset]       | follow  | The angle of the projectile image is the same as the movement angle of the projectile, and it is offset by a certain angle |   ['F',-90]   |
| ['R',speed,loadInitialRotation] | rotate  | The image can rotate auto.The unit is angle/frame.<br />loadInitialRotation:if load the value of attribute initialRotation as the initial vlaue of img\`s rotation. | ['R',2,false] |
|           ['S',value]           | stable  |    The rotation of image is stationary.The unit is angle.    |   ['S',10]    |
